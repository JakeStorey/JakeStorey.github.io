        <h1>Amusing Websites</h1>
        <p>If you are ever bored, the Internet has thousands of sites to cure it. On this page, I have included three websites that make me laugh. </p>

        <h2>Baseball Bloopers</h2>
        <p>Personally, I love baseball. If, Im bored at night, I normally watch a game. However, when there are no MLB games on TV, I like to throw on some bloopers. What's a better way to cure your boredom than watching professionals make simple mistakes?</p>
