        <h2>What makes a hero?</h2>
        <p>Elon Musk is the perfect definition of a hero. 
            His success with Tesla, SpaceX, and Starlink is not about his own success but the success of humanity. 
            His goal is to uplift others whether it be cheaper transportation, interet for all, or space exploration. 
            He wants to instill a sense of belief and hope for future civilization. His selfless actions inspire me and that is why he is my hero.</p>
