        <h2>What makes a hero?</h2>
        <p>Elon Musk is the perfect definition of a hero. 
            His companies such as Tesla, SpaceX, and Starlink are not about pride or money, but about the overall success of humanity. 
            His goal is to uplift others whether it be cheaper transportation, interet for all, or space exploration. 
            He wants to instill a sense of belief and hope for future civilization. His selfless actions inspire me and that is why he is my hero.</p>
